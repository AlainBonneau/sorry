## A Letter from You

You were someone who meant a lot to me, and you still do. I know, it might seem fast, but I can't control how I feel. I experience things deeply, and the friendship I felt for you might appear sudden or strange, but it was, and still is, incredibly sincere.

I miss you. I miss talking to you. I miss laughing, playing, even those little random chats.

All I ever wanted was to be a good friend to you. I never expected something more. I never tried to force anything. Maybe I made mistakes, yes. Maybe I sent too many messages. Maybe I scared you by showing too much emotion. But I always did it with kindness, not anger, and certainly not pressure.

I respected your silence, your time, your decisions, even when they hurt me. And I never blamed you, even when I was in pain. I just wanted one thing: to talk. To understand. To apologize if I hurt you, and to hear from you sincerely, even just once.

But for weeks, I was blocked. Not just by you, but by your friend, even your brother mocked me… That was hard. It made me feel like I wasn’t a person anymore, like I was just a bad memory to delete. And that hurt so much, more than I can explain.

And still… I never hated you. I never disrespected you. I never said bad things about you. I always defended you. Because I care.

Now I’m tired. Tired of silence. Tired of hoping. Tired of not knowing.

That’s why I reached out one last time, to ask: Can we be friends again? Can you unblock me on Instagram? Not so we talk every day, but just to know that maybe someday, we could. Just one small gesture from you would have meant the world to me.

If you didn’t want that, you could have just said “no.” I would’ve understood. But being ignored completely, it broke me.

Even now, if you’re reading this… know that I’m still here. Still hoping for a sign. Still believing that somewhere in your heart, maybe you care, even just a little.

But if not, that’s okay too. I’ll let go.

Thank you for the little moments. Thank you for letting me care about you, even if just for a while.

Take care, Minnie.
